# discord-call

This is a script I threw together that allows players in Garry's Mod to call staff via Discord. If you want to use this on your own server, you MUST edit lua/autorun/config.lua. Generate a Discord Webhook and put it in there. The rest of the options are optional.

It should work by just adding this to your addons folder.

# For Developers

If you want to create your own menu (since I just used default derma cause it's easier), simply have a string that is sent to the networked string "CallDiscord".

Also, currently, I just send the data to a personal free webserver. If you want to host the web part of it for yourself, PM me and I'll get you the web file - @crossboy#6829.

Have fun.
